So what are you waiting for? Start infecting the city!\r\n\r\n# About\r\nB.I.O.S is a Ludum Dare 48 entry for the 25th competition. It happens to also be my first game published online, and I'm quite proud of that. The game consists of a city, that has different buildings. Your goal is to infect each building & take over the entire city with computer viruses. However, each building has it's own security systems in place (Randomly generated based off the security level of the building). This requires you to learn what viruses interact with various types of anti-virus (These have no relation to real life hacking, just content in the game).\r\n\r\n# Download\r\nYou can find the runnable jar file [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/30616242/LD-Game.zip) along with more information to play inside the zip file. ** This does require Java 6 or higher** to play. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Source\r\nAs per Ludum Dare rules, the game is open source, and can be found on my github [here](https://github.com/deadlybutter/B.I.O.S). However I will warn you, it's very messy, hackish, and stuff is just everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"B.i.o.s"}
